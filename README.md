# Challanges

+ This project was my first introduction to CRUD and SQLite. I had to learn these technologies from the very beginning to write this application. 

# Resources Used
+ [Microsoft documentation for setting up SQLite](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/data/sqlite/?tabs=net-cli)
+ Various articles on StackOverflow
